Toggle password visibility on the WordPress login screen.

== Description ==

Lets you easily show or hide the contents of the password field on the WordPress login screen. Uses the excellent [hideShowPassword](https://github.com/cloudfour/hideShowPassword) jQuery plugin by the equally excellent [Cloud Four](http://cloudfour.com/).

= Options =

A settings section is added to the 'General Settings' page. You can select between toggling password visibility via an icon in the password field (default) or via a checkbox below the password field.

= Translations =

The default setting of toggling the password via an icon in the password field does not require translation as no text will be visible to the user. If you select the option of toggling the password via a checkbox, the following translations are included:

* Dutch
* German
