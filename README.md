==============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/barryceelen/wp-hide-show-password.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/barryceelen/wp-hide-show-password)

**Discontinued:** This plugin is no longer under active development: ❤️ WordPress core supports a similar [password visibility toggle button on the login screen](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/10/10/wordpress-5-3-adds-a-show-button-next-to-the-password-field-on-the-login-screen/) by default since version 5.3.

The hideShowPassword for WordPress plugin lets you easily show or hide the contents of the password field on the WordPress login screen.
Uses the excellent [hideShowPassword](https://github.com/cloudfour/hideShowPassword) jQuery plugin by the equally excellent [Cloud Four](https://github.com/cloudfour/).
